# Global CO2emissions by Country 

## The project will be analyzing and sorting the data of different countries CO2 emissions. 
### The data set includes a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It states data on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics. The data was last download 3/29/2023 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv
a. Global CO2 Emissions showed in Accordance to Countries

b. The lab looks at the CO2 emissions of different countries, but focuses on the trends on the top ten emittors of CO2 in 2020. The problem within the data is that the there were some countries that contributed greater amounts of CO2 emssions than others and created outliers within the data. This was mitigated by creating a denisty scale for the histogram and showing the line graph on a log scale. After proper analysis of the visuals, it was conclused that from 1971 to 2020 there has been an overall postive trend in global CO2 emissions with China and the United States contributing to the highest levels.

c. Python was the software used in this project. Python is a high-level programming languge. The language packages used in this project were pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.

d. In this repository the greenhouse gas emission data from the set owid-co2-data.csv from Our World in Data. Our World in Data is scientific publication of data the focuses on global issues, such as clmiate change. This is the link to the data used: https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-data.csv

e. As a part of data processing, a major step taken to clena the data was filing the raw data set into a csv. This allowed for the data to be oraganized into a package concise enough to work with.
